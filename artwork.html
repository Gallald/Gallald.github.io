        <p1>Below you will see a few of the pieces I have created using various programs such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Affinity Designer.</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Love Birds</button>

        <div class="content">
            <p3>
                For this piece, I chose two words to create out of.  The two words in this piece are "Love" and "Birds", the birds created
                out of the word "bird", and the heart out of "love". 
            </p3>
                <img id="LoveBirds" src="assets/images/art/Love_Birds.jpg" alt="Love Birds" height="100%" width="100%">   
        </div>

        <br>
<!-- Kissing Eyes -->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Kissing Eyes</button>

        <div class="content">
            <br>
            <p3>
                Like the piece above, this piece created using two words for one piece.  The two words used here were "Kissing" and "Eyes."
            </p3>
            <img id="KissingEyes" src="assets/images/art/Kissing_Eyes_GD.jpg" alt="Kissing Eyes" height="100%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
<!-- GBC -->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">GameBoy Color</button>

        <div class="content">
            <br />
            <p3>Once of my favorites, I've created this piece using only the pen tool for the shapes, aside from the text itself.  The Gameboy Color
                was my first console, and it wasn't long after playing that I knew
                I wanted to pursue game design as my career.
            </p3>
            <img id="GBC" src="assets/images/art/GBC_lines_GD.jpg" alt="GameBoy Color made with just lines" height="100%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
<!-- Pride Flag -->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Pride Flag</button>

        <div class="content">
            <br>        
            <p3>
                This piece was created after the tragic events of George Floyd, which incited protests to tell the world that we are all equal and deserve
                the chance to live with equality amongst one another.
            </p3>
            <img id="PrideFlag" src="assets/images/art/PRIDE.png" alt="Pride Flag 1" height="100%" width="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
<!-- Betsy Pride-->
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Betsy Pride Flag</button>

        <div class="content">
            <br>  
            <p3>
                A variant of the piece before, using a pattern similar to the Betsy Ross flag.
            </p3>
            <img id="BetsyPrideFlag" src="assets/images/art/BETSY_PRIDE.png" alt="Betsy Pride Flag" height="100%" width="100%">
