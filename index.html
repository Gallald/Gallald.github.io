			<h1>Who I am</h1>
	
			<p>My name is Gallal Dharhan.  
				I am an aspiring graphic designer, programmer, and web designer, with strong dedication to any project I set my mind to.  
				I am a team-oriented leader who can also take charge when working alone, and will always deliver more than what was asked.
			</p>

			<h2>My goals</h2>
			<p>My goal in life is to help others through technology.  With the world gradually moving more and more towards remote work, more people will rely on technology
				in order to move through their daily lives, especially as technology continues to advance now more than ever.
			</p>

			<p>Use the menu to navigate through my website.  I am confident in my abilities to take on whatever task necessary with nothing less of perfection.</p>
