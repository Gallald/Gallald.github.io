			<h1>Who I am</h1>
	
			<p2>My name is Gallal Dharhan.  
				I am an aspiring graphic designer, programmer, and web designer, with strong dedication to any project I set my mind to.  
				I am a team-oriented leader who can also take charge when working alone, and will always deliver more than what was asked.
				I enjoy stories and emotions through artwork, and how we can all see the world in a different matter even when we look at the same thing.
				I believe that through artwork, web design, and more, we can share our stories and connect with one another.
			</2p>

			<p2>Use the menu to navigate through my website, including my artwork and resume.  
			   I am confident in my abilities to take on whatever task necessary with nothing less of perfection.</p2>
