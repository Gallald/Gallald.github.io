            <p>
            <b><i>Encryption</i></b
            >, by definition, is "the process of converting information or data into a
            code, especially to prevent unauthorized access".

            <h1>What is Decryption?</h1>

            <p>
            <b><i>Decryption</i></b
            >, by definition, is the opposite of encryption, which is the conversion
            of encrypted data back into its original form.

            <b><i>Caesar</i></b> encryption is one of the earliest and simplest of
            encryption methods.  The writer of the message and the recipient together 
            devise a numeric "key" value between 1 and 25, which is then used to encrypt 
            through shifting forward that many letters in the alphabet. <br> <br>
            For example,
            If the key value is 4 and the message is "A," the encrypted version 
            of the message would be "E." <br> <br>
            When the recipient receives the message, 
            s/he decrypts it by shifting the same number of letters backwards in the alphabet. 
            "E" shifted backwards 4 spaces would then return the decrypted message of "A."  <br> <br>
            As another example, if the plaintext was "HELLO" and the key value was 3, the resulting 
            encrypted message would be: "KHOOR"; to decrypt, you'd move back 3 spaces and recover the 
            message "HELLO."

            <b><i>Pigpen</i></b> encryption is a bit more complicated than the
            previous two. It involves a system of grids, dots, and in some cases,
            <i>x</i>'s. In order to decypher the message, one must find the letter
            corresponding to the letter in the given grid, using the dots to determine
            which grid to look at, and the shape of the symbol to figure out which
            letter to choose. For example, if we were given the symbols:<br />
            <img
                src="/assets/images/Pigpen_Ex.png"
            />
            <br />using the key below:<br />
            <img
                src="/assets/images/Pigpen_Full.jpg"
            />
            <br />We can see that the encrypted message says "HELLO"<br />
